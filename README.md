# Automatic-Stock-Prediction

A crucial and difficult challenge for investors is learning how to make wise selections while
trading stocks. The primary goal of this specific application of reinforcement learning is to
assess whether a DRL agent can automatically make trading judgements and generate long-term
consistent profits given that DRL has surpassed humans in many areas, such as playing Atari
games. In this project, we will be explore the ensemble trading strategy using three actor-critic
based algorithms: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Advantage Actor Critic (A2C), and
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). We will attempt to simulate the results of the
primary paper and will try to suggest improvements to obtain better results.
